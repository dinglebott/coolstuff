            <p id="intro" class="unscrollable">The Big Bang remains one of the most mysterious moments in our Universe's history to date. 
                This is mainly because no one was around to see it happen. However, we do have some ideas...</p>

                <h2>Contents of the Universe</h2>
                <p>At first, there were almost equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which annihilated each other 
                    almost instantly. However, there was a TINY bit of matter left over, roughly 0.0000033%. 
                    In other words, for every 30 million kg of antimatter, there was 30 million and 1 kg of matter! 
                    That leftover matter makes up every galaxy, star, and planet we see today.</p>

                <h2>Cosmic Microwave Background</h2>
                <p>It took 380,000 years after the Big Bang for the Universe to become transparent. This was when 
                    the very first atoms formed, turning the Universe from an opaque plasma into a gas. (Before this it 
                    was too hot to form stable atoms.) The light that travelled the Universe at this point, originating 
                    all the way from the Big Bang, can still be seen today!</p>

                    a background of microwave from every direction at the same time.</p>

                <h2>Nature of the Big Bang</h2>
                <p>NOTHING is known about the actual singularity we spawned from. Our two existing frameworks to explain 
                    all of reality are <span>general relativity</span> and <span>quantum mechanics</span>. The two theories 
                    are fundamentally different in how they conceptualise our reality, and CANNOT agree with each other.</p>
                <p>Usually, relativity is applicable at cosmic scales (stars and planets), while quantum mechanics is used 
                    at quantum scales (electrons and quarks), and thus they don't overlap. However, singularities like 
                    the Big Bang are a rare circumstance where BOTH relativistic and quantum effects are significant. 
                    This is where our theories fail us, because we have NO CLUE how to do it.</p>
                <p>The only known places in the Universe with similar conditions are the singularities inside black holes. 
                    Which are a bit hard to reach. So we currently have nothing concrete to really study in this field...</p>
